			<p>
				Hello, I'm Siful Siddiki, and I'm currently a student at the State University at Buffalo. I am pursuing a BS in Computer Science and plan on becoming an engineer in the near future. As a kid I enjoyed math and want to approach a profession in it. I love basketball, video games, and math. I hope to be a software developer and these are just certain things about me.

			<h3>Future Aspirations</h3>
			<p>
				When I grow up I want to use engineering and math in order to solve many daily problems in life. For example I know math won't help solve world hunger but I would like to make buildings and such that help poor neighborhoods become thriving ciries.
